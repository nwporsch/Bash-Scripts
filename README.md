# Bash-Scripts
## CheckPintos
This file can be used with the Pintos Operating System to run tests while you are still coding and checking things. To do this add this file to your ~/bin directory and add the bin directory to your .bash_profile $PATH variable. Make sure to run bash before running checkPintos and also make sure to add the executable flag. Also make sure to edit line 2 so it goes to the src/threads directory of pintos.
### Things to change about script
